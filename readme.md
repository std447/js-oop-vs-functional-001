# JS programming paradigm OOP and Functional

OOP (Object Oriented Programming) or Functional Programming is not a programming language but is style or way of writing your code.

## Attempted to write same functionality using 3 approaches

1. Procedural Approach
    - Simplest approach, most beginners start with
    - Code is written in step-by-step manner
    - Not organised/seperated by logical blocks

1. Object Oriented Programming approach
    - This has been very popular approach since last 2-3 decades
    - Second to simple approach in comparision to Procedural programming style
    - Code is divided in logical blocks in terms classes representing objects and its methods
    - Code can be well organised and robust

1. Functional approach
    - This is gaining popularity in recent times
    - This approach might be difficult for inexperianced programmers
    - We write code in terms of pure functions with least amount of side effects
    - Code can we well organised and robust

> This is very trvial example not depending on any external libraries. To start experimenting with this repo - 
1. You can fork this repo

    OR - Create a local copy
    
1. Create a new directory or folder. Open that directory in your favorate IDE (ex. VS Code). Open terminal and run following commands

```
  git clone https://github.com/std447/js-oop-vs-functional-001.git
```
And you are ready to start
